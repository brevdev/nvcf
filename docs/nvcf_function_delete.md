## nvcf function delete

Delete a function. If you want to delete a specific version, use the --version-id flag.

### Synopsis

Delete a function. If there is only 1 version, we will delete the function. If there are multiple versions, we will prompt you to specify which version to delete. The --all flag will delete all versions of the function. Deleting a deployed function will change a function status to INACTIVE and using the --force flag will delete the function immediately.
